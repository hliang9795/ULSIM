# ULSIM
Simulation of UL feasibility

## Backgroud
A insurance agent tried very hard to sell me an Universal Life insurance policy to me. The policy also provides *living benefits*, which you can take out against the policy's cash value when there is critical illness. It sounds very enticing. Before I buy the policy, I need to know whether it is good deal, and what would happen if I indeed using the living benefits.
